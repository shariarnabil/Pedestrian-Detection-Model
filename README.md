# Pedestrian-Detection-Model
# Pedestrian Detection using YOLOv3 in Google Colab

This project demonstrates pedestrian detection in a video using the **YOLOv3** object detection model. The YOLOv3 model is pre-trained on the COCO dataset and detects pedestrians in real-time in uploaded videos.

## Features

- **Pedestrian Detection**: Detects people in a video using YOLOv3.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Processes each frame in the video and detects pedestrians.
- **Bounding Boxes**: Draws bounding boxes around detected pedestrians.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**: For video processing.
- **YOLOv3**: Pre-trained object detection model for detecting pedestrians.
- **Matplotlib**: For displaying the detection results.
